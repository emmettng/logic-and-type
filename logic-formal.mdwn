## Natural Deduction 



1. Intuition of proof procedure (`stack style`)
    
    - $\cfrac{}{T}$ : at the top of the formula 
    >> `semantics` : `T` depends on nothing to be true $\iff$ `T` is the logic-truth.  
    >> $\models T \iff \cfrac{}{T}$ 
    - $\cfrac{A}{O}$ : at the top of the formula
    >> There is `NO` bar over `A` $\iff$ `A` is an assumption.   
    >> `O` is the output of current rule.   
    >> `semantics` : `O` depends on the assumption `A` being true $\iff$ $... A \vdash O$
    - $\cfrac{I}{C}$:  `NOT` at the top of the formula
    >> There is other formula over `I`.   
    >> `semantics` : `I ` is the inference output of previous rule and input current rule.   
    >> `semantics` : `C` is the inference output of current rule.

    There are two roles (players) in natural deduction:
    >- . Inference rules, they are basically `n-ary` functions, it contains: 
    >   - n inference inputs (one or more) (wff or subproofs)
    >   - inference output (one)
    >- . Assumptions (need to trace undischarged assumptions)

    example:
    >![natural deduction example](.imags/../imgs/natural_example.jpg)
    > example of showing $\neg (P \land Q) \rightarrow (\neg P \lor \neg Q)$


    >![natural deduction example](.imags/../imgs/natural_func_1.jpg)
    > Inference rules are functions that take one wff as input $\lor I$ or two wff as inputs $\land I$.

    >![natural deduction example](.imags/../imgs/natural_func_2.jpg)
    > Inference rules are functions that take subproofs and a wff as input ($\lor E$).   
    > This function ($\lor E$) discharges the dependencies of some assumption in subproofs .  
    > eg. Function $\lor E$ is of type:
    > - $\lor E$ :: $(...\vdash \alpha \lor \beta) \rightarrow (... \alpha \vdash \gamma) \rightarrow (... \beta \vdash \gamma) \rightarrow  (...\vdash \gamma)$  
        >> - it takes three input arguments and return one output  
        >> - `...` represent whatever assumptions not been discharged (`dependencies`) up to the proof of following theorem.   
        >> - therefore, $\vdash$ can be seen as an `infix function` ($inputs \vdash outputs$). This tuple (`input`, `output`) describes the relation between whatever (`context` / `assumptions`) needed to prove the (`theorem` / `conclusion`). It has the type: $(\vdash) :: inputs \rightarrow outputs$.
    >
    >> arg 1: $(...\vdash \alpha \lor \beta)$ , based on whatever context assumptions we have proved $\alpha \lor \beta$      
    >> arg 2: $(... \alpha \vdash \gamma)$ , based on the assumption that $\alpha$ we proved $\gamma$  
    >> arg 3: $(... \beta \vdash \gamma)$ , based on the assumption that $\beta $ we proved $\gamma$  
    >> return : $... \vdash \gamma$ , based on `undischarged` context assumptions of argument 1,2,3 we proved $\gamma$.

    >> - so get `output` :          : ($\gamma$ can be proved for sure given context in `arg 1, 2, 3`, assumptions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ can be `discharged`, because the `output` contains information being carried by $arg 1,2,3$)

    >> $arg 3$ $:=$ $\neg P \vdash \neg P \lor \neg Q$    
    >> $output$  = $... \vdash \neg P \lor \neg Q$   
    >
    > `Red parts in the above chart`
    > - $arg 1$ is replaced by ' $\vdash \neg P \lor P$ ', because of `law of excluded middle` (in classical logic) $\neg P \lor P$ is a logic-truth (axiom), it depends on no assumptions(context), so there is nothing before $\vdash$.
    > - $arg 2$ is replaced by ' $... P \vdash \neg P \lor \neg Q$ ', `...` refers to other two assumptions $\neg (P \land Q)$ and $Q$. 
    > - $arg 3$ is replaced by ' $\neg P \vdash \neg P \lor \neg Q$ '
    > - output is $... \vdash \neg P \lor \neg Q$, the `...` here is the context of $arg 2$, assumption $P$ in $arg 2$ and assumption $\neg P$ in $arg 3$ are discharged. subtitle `1`.
    > - out goal is to discharge all assumptions and context of $arg 2$.  $\neg (P \land Q)$ and $Q$  are discharged by functions $\lor E_2$ and $\rightarrow I_3$ respectively.

    >![natural deduction example](.imags/../imgs/natural_func_3.jpg)
    > - inference rule is a function that takes a subproof as input ($\rightarrow I$)  
    > - this function ($\rightarrow I$) summarize the relation between assumption and proved conclusion. The output is independent from the input subproof, so that some assumption can be discharged (intuitive explanation below, formal discussion in deduction theorem )

    >![natural deduction example](.imags/../imgs/natural_LEM.jpg)
    > - inference rule like this do not need any assumption, so that it can be placed in any where needed.

    **Summary**
    - Every wff has no `bar` on top of it is an Assumption. Should be placed at the left side of $\vdash$.  
    - `bar` is some inference rule, a function, the takes subproof or wff as inputs and provide theorem as output. These functions preserve truth, in other word they guarantee the validity between `input` and `output`.    
    - Every wff under a `bar` is an theorem proved by a function (`an inference rule`) evaluation of some kind of inputs (`subproof or wff`).  Should be placed at the right side of $\vdash$.   
    - `rules that take subproof as inputs allow us to discharge assumptions` : information in subproof has been included in the output of inference rule.
     
2. Sets of inference rules: 

    There are many different set of inference rules. Each set could guarantee both `soundness` and `completeness`. In the book (`logic: the laws of truth`) there are five set of rules as follow: 
    - N1 .
    ![n1](imgs/n1.png)
    - N2 .  N3 . N4 . N5 . 
     
        ![n2-5](imgs/n2-n5.png)
        ![n2-5 details](imgs/n2-n5_detail.png)

    - It is clear that: $\neg$ `introduction` and `elimination` can be replaced by many other rules and vice versa. 
    - `TND` is `LEM (law of excluded middle)` and this is the one difference between `classical logic` and `constructive logic`. 
    - $\neg$  how this is being interpreted is another difference between `classical logic` and `constructive logic`. 
  
3. Discharge   
    >   `inference rule are function that take inputs and return output`

    >   `rules that take subproof as inputs allow us to discharge assumptions` :   
    >   information of subproof is being included in the output of inference.

   - material conditional : $\rightarrow$
    ![conditional discharge](./imgs/conditional_discharge.jpg)
    ```
    Given a set of assumptions to be true.
    It proofs a conclusion to be true
    ```
    - **Line One** : This relation that assumptions proofs conclusion indicates the existence of ' $\vdash$ ' between assumptions and conclusion. we say $\vdash$ is `True`.
    ```
    Given a set of assumptions to be true. 
    It failed to proof the conclusion to be true
    ```
   - **Line Two**: This relation that assumptions failed to proof conclusion indicates the non-existence of ' $\vdash$ ' between assumptions and conclusion. we say $\vdash$ is `False`.

    ```
    Given a set of assumptions to be false, it is equivalent to no assumptions at all.
    The logic-truth conclusion depends on no assumption.
    ```
    - **Line Three**: This relation that a conclusion is true depends on no assumption indicates the existence of  ' $\vdash$ ' between nothing and a conclusion. We say $\vdash$ is `True` and represent logic-truth conclusion as $\vdash C$.

    ```
    Given a set of assumptions to be false, it is equivalent to no assumptions at all.
    And we fail to prove the conclusion to be true.
    ```
    - **Line Four**: the semantic of $\vdash$ is to prove some conclusion to be `True`, thus the `False` assumption and `False` conclusion does not included in the expression of $\vdash$. So the existance of $\vdash$ relation between assumption and conclusion is not effected by this line. We say $\vdash$ is `True`.

    **Conclusion:**  
    - *Relations being represented by line 1-4 is the same as the relation expressed by material condition $\rightarrow$*.
    - Information existence pattern used to describe $\vdash$ is included in $\rightarrow$, so discharge the assumption after reaching $\rightarrow$ is fine. 
    - Whenever we write down $A \rightarrow B$ it always means this relation between $A$ and $B$ exists, thus the line One exists.
    - This is the intuitive understanding, formal discussion is the proof of **deduction theorem**.

4. Introduction and Elimination
   - `introduction` rules capture the process you use to prove a certain kind of statement, while the 
   - `elimination` rules explain how to use a fact you have already proved. 
    >For example, to prove φ→ψ, you first assume φ, and then your new goal is to prove ψ. This is captured by the → introduction rule. (`Capture` is as described in `discharge` part of `→` )

5. Set, Function and True
   `True` indicate the existence of a relation. 

   - something is exist     
   - something is not exist 

    Truth and existential 
        --> detailed discussion combine with above discharge introduction

    proof is about prove something to be true, even if we would like to proof a proposition $A$ to be false, it always start witha $\neg A$. 
    All proof process pass truth in their structure  
    But why not `Falsity` ?  it is related to tht relation between existence and `Being True`.
