# formal logic 

## Natural Deduction 

1. Intuition of proof procedure
    - $\cfrac{}{T}$ : at the top of the formular
    >> `semantics` : `T` depends on nothing to be true $\iff$ `T` is the logic-truth.  
    >> $\models T \iff \cfrac{}{T}$ 
    - $\cfrac{A}{O}$ This is at the top of the formular
    >> There is `NO` bar over `A` $\iff$ `A` is an assumption.   
    >> `O` is the output of current rule.   
    >> `semantics` : `O` depends on the assumption `A` being true $\iff$ $... A \vdash O$
    - $\cfrac{I}{C}$:  `NOT` at the top of the formular
    >> There is other fomular over `I`.   
    >> `semantics` : `I ` is the inference output of previous rule and input current rule.   
    >> `semantics` : `C` is the inference output of current rule.

    There are two roles (players) in natural deduction:
    >- . Inference rules, they are basically `n-ary` functions, it contains: 
    >   - inference inputs (one or more) 
    >   - inference output (one)
    >- . Assumptions 
TODO: an example to explain above concepts:
