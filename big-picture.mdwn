The illustration of this big-picture focus on ***the cause effect relation***. 

I would like to know: 

1. The origin of a **Theory**
    - What problem this **Theory** want to solve ? 
1. The limitation of a **Theory**
    - Contradiction 
    - philosophy paradox
    - compensate **Theory**

Based on understanding of previous two points, there are two kinds of relations between theories:
   - Relation Between theories. 
        **Theory B** could be developed for fixing some problem of **Theory A**.
   - Differences between theories.
        **Theory B**, **Theory C**, **Theory D** ... these theories all aims to fix certain problem of **Theory A** however each focus on different aspect.
